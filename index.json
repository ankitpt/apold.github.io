A diverse range of sources contributes to India’s air pollution, with common culprits including biomass burning, industrial discharges, power generation, and traffic emissions. 1 One frequently overlooked yet highly prevalent source is trash burning. In Indian cities, 50% to 90% of trash may be collected from homes and businesses, but collected trash ends up in large municipal dump sites (which accumulate 35–45 million tons [~ 32–40 metric tons] of trash each year across India). Burning is typically the only removal method, as alternative waste management techniques can be costly or difficult to implement. 1 Waste that is not collected and transported to municipal sites is usually burned at or near residences and along roadsides. Since these burning activities often occur in close proximity to people, emissions from trash burning likely are a significant source of daily exposure to particulate matter. Although daily cumulative emissions generated by trash.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"An example journal article","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ankit Patel","Robert Ford"],"categories":null,"content":"\rClick the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.\r\r\r\rClick the Slides button above to demo Academic\u0026rsquo;s Markdown slides feature.\r\r\rSupplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.\n","date":1372636800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1372636800,"objectID":"69425fb10d4db090cfbd46854715582c","permalink":"https://ankitpt.github.io/publication/conference-paper/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper/","section":"publication","summary":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
