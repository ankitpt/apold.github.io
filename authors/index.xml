      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a Masters student in Geomatics at Purdue University with interest in machine and deep learning based geospatial data analytics. Currently, I am working under Dr Ayman Habib as a member of Digital Photogrammetry and Research group (DPRG) on lane marking extraction from LiDAR intensity images through deep learning. I have also worked on satellite imagery (hyperspectral data) classification via Support Vector Machines and Contextual Deep CNN. Currently, I am seeking full time or internship opportunities in field of data analytics once I graduate in May 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from academics, I am a huge Manchester United fan and regularly follow them. I like to listen to and take part in enthusiastic soccer discussions. I also love cooking which is certainly not a bad skill/hobby to have as a graduate student :)&lt;/p&gt;
